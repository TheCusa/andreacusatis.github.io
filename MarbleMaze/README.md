# Marble Maze — Unreal Engine



**Marble Maze** is a physics-based puzzle game built using **Unreal Engine**. The player guides a marble through a maze by tilting the board with the mouse. The game leverages Unreal Engine’s powerful physics engine to simulate realistic marble rolling, friction, and collision.

## Description



The objective is simple: navigate the marble to the goal area while avoiding holes scattered across the board. The entire experience is physics-driven — the tilt of the board determines the direction and speed of the marble’s movement. The board’s surface remains uniform throughout the levels, and the only obstacles are the holes that the player must avoid.

## Game Engine



 **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 (compatible with Unreal Engine 4.27 or later)

**Physics:** Powered by Unreal’s built-in Chaos Physics engine for realistic rolling and collision responses.

## Key Features



- Physics-driven marble movement using the Chaos Physics engine

- Mouse-based tilt controls for intuitive gameplay

- Uniform board surface for consistent friction and rolling speed

- Holes as the sole obstacles that challenge the player’s precision

- Clean and minimalist user interface with timer and restart options

- Adjustable difficulty through level design (hole placement and board incline)

## Controls



**Mouse:** simply move the mouse to tilt the board in any direction.

The tilt directly affects the marble’s velocity and direction based on gravity and friction.
